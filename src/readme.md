ðŸ“š **Project Description**

The project is using Node.js, GraphQL, TypeGraphQL, and Apollo Server to showcase the differences between a schema-first and code-first approach. The `server-schema-first-approach.ts` file demonstrates the schema-first approach, where we define a schema before creating GraphQL queries and mutations. On the other hand, the `server-code-first-approach.ts` file illustrates the code-first approach, where we can use decorators to automatically generate the schema for us.

ðŸ’» **Getting Started**

To start the server using the code-first approach, run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This command will transpile the `src/server-code-first-approach.ts` file and restart the server whenever changes are made.

To start the server using the schema-first approach, execute the following command:

```
npm run dev:simple
```

This command will transpile the `src/server-schema-first-approach.ts` file and automatically restart the server upon changes.
